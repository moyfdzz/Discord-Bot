# Discord Bot

A discord bot created with JavaScript, Node.js and Discord.js

## Getting Started

To invite the discord bot to your server, copy the following link into your browser:

```
https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=498314852071374858&permissions=0&scope=bot
```

### Project Setup

What things I needed to start developing the discord bot and how to install them

Node.js
```
http://nodejs.org/
```

Discord.js
```
https://discord.js.org/
```

## Deployment

To deploy it manually, use the following command:
```
node index.js
```

You can install nodemon in case you want the bot to update automatically whenever you add or modify a function:
```
https://nodemon.io/
```

Then you can run the bot with the following command:
```
nodemon index.js
```

Now you can run once the bot and test the functions.
